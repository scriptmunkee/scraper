        Most Common SEO Questions
		
              What is SEO?SEO stands for Search Engine Optimisation. It's a process of improving websites in order to drive more visits, visibility and conversions via search engines such as Google.

		
		
              Why is SEO important?SEO provides businesses with much needed visibility in order to attract customers. 87% of shoppers begin their searches for products online. SEO can be the difference between a customer choosing your business over a competitors’.

		
		
              How long does it take to start seeing results?SEO can take a long time. With some sites, you can see results in the first few weeks, but in some cases it can take months. However, once you start seeing results, your organic search traffic should start increasing steadily.

		
		
              Which is better, SEO or PPC?SEO and PPC are both valuable methods of driving traffic to your webpage. However, SEO has been shown to be the best long term marketing strategy for businesses online. While SEO results are not instant like PPC, investing in good quality SEO will improve your long term ROI where PPC falls short.
