## How We Deliver Our SEO Services

Step 1. The Discovery Call: Deep Dive into Your Business Story.  

During our discovery call, we're keen to hear about you, your business journey, and your aspirations. This conversation will allow us to pinpoint the keywords crucial for your growth.  

Within this conversation, we'll introduce you to our Situational Analysis™ which will provide an overview of your current organic digital footprint, the health of your website, and bespoke SEO improvement recommendations. Click here to view a sample of our Situational Analysis™, using our website as a case study.  
  
Our session will also feature a Mini Keyword Research activity. Based on insights from your Google Search Console and competitive keyword analysis, we'll spotlight potential keywords in your niche. Together, we'll sculpt a prioritised list of keywords to target. To wrap up, we'll discuss our On-Page Recommendations for your highest-performing pages, paving the path for swift actionable improvements in the very first week!

Step 2. Comprehensive Technical Audit: Unearthing Technical Pitfalls.  

Following our call, we'll embark on a comprehensive technical audit, revealing any pitfalls in your website that could hamper SEO effectiveness. Given that even top-tier sites often have numerous areas for optimization, we'll be thorough in identifying and rectifying any errors.

Step 3. Keyword Integration & Topical Mapping: Structuring Success.  

With the insights from our discovery dialogue, we embed the chosen keywords into our tracking system. At the same time, we lay out a topical map, setting the tone for a coherent content narrative.  

Step 4. Roadmap Reveal: Strategizing the Climb to the Top of Google.  

After the above actions have been finalised, we’ll jump on a call and will walk you through each step, strategy, and tactic designed to catapult you to page 1, position 1 ranking.  
  
In month one, every action is orchestrated to lay a rock-solid foundation, merging technical prowess, content strategy, and a deep understanding of your brand's essence.

Step 1: Campaign Strategy Development  

In our second month, we craft a tailored campaign strategy centred on your unique goals. Our expert team assembles a precise content roadmap for the next three months, influenced by your core interests and what users are searching for.  

Step 2: Keyword and Analytics Refinement  

We revisit our data analytics tools, refining our keyword approach and ensuring all growth opportunities are tracked.  

Step 3: Internal Linking Optimisation  

Our attention then turns to optimising internal linking, ensuring prime keywords are strategically anchored, enhancing both user navigation and SEO prominence.  

Step 4: Intensive Technical Audit  

Our technical efforts intensify with a deeper audit, evolving prior findings into actionable tech tasks.  

Step 5: Weekly On-Page Recommendations  

We maintain our momentum with weekly On-Page Recommendations, ensuring alignment with your goals.  

Step 6: Content Brief Preparation  

As the month winds down, we commence drafting new content briefs, preparing for quality content ahead.  
  
In summary, month 2 sharpens our strategy, technical optimisation, and content groundwork, propelling you towards SEO excellence.

Month

Step 1. Building Bridges: Initiating Light Link-Building and Citation Creation.  

As we delve into the third month, the emphasis shifts towards fortifying your digital presence. Depending on your unique scenario, we'll commence light link-building or citation creation, further enhancing your SEO footprint.  

Step 2. Laying the Link-Building Groundwork: From Guest Posts to Niche Edits.  

Your website's authority is pivotal for SEO success. Hence, we'll draft the cornerstone of a robust link-building strategy, encompassing tactics like guest posting and niche edits. This ensures that your site garners not only traffic but the right kind of engagements from authoritative sources.  

Step 3. Outreach Campaign: Seamless Prospecting and Engagement.  

With the strategy in place, we'll transition to prospecting. Identifying potential partners and opportunities is crucial, and we ensure that every prospect aligns with your brand ethos. Subsequently, a well-crafted outreach campaign will be rolled out, targeting these handpicked prospects, nurturing relationships and fostering collaborations.  

Step 4. Consistent Monitoring with OPRs: Staying on Track.  

OPRs remain our compass, guiding us and ensuring we remain on course with your objectives. Regular checks guarantee that our strategies are translating into tangible outcomes.  

Step 5. Content Continuation: Drafting New Briefs.  

Content remains king. As month three advances, we'll initiate new content briefs, ensuring that your platform is constantly refreshed with relevant, engaging, and SEO-optimised material.  
  
In essence, month 3 is a blend of strategy and execution, strengthening ties in the digital realm while consistently producing quality content, propelling us forward in our shared SEO journey.

Month

Step 1. Campaign Performance Analysis: Reflect, Refine, and Rejuvenate.  

In this phase, we re-examine the progress made so far, ensuring we're on track to achieve the goals we set out in the initial months. Our team will dive deep into the analytics to gauge the effectiveness of the campaign, understanding areas of success and points needing improvement.  

Step 2. Page Performance & OPRs Overview: Gauging Individual Impact.  

Here, we'll scrutinise the performance of new pages added, as well as delve into the analytics of individual On-Page Recommendations (OPRs). The beauty lies in the details; hence, we ensure each OPR, whether basic or advanced, resonates with our overarching SEO objectives. We also ensure seamless access to performance metrics by embedding these in the OPRs spreadsheet.  

Step 3. Technical Refresher: Maintaining the Momentum.  

Staying updated is key. In this step, we revisit your website's technical health to identify any new hiccups or changes since our last deep dive. It’s a way to ensure the smooth functioning of the SEO strategy.  

Step 4. Action Plans: Converting Insights into Strategies.  

Post our technical refresher, it's action time. Whether it's rectifying errors, implementing fresh strategies based on the refresher, or constructing new content briefs, this step is about moving forward strategically. Furthermore, if any links were acquired in month 3, we’ll employ tiered link-building methods to maximise their potential.  

Step 5. Reviving The Content Narrative: Authority, Topicality, and Engagement.  

Here, we’ll delve into the content creation strategy. Understanding the significance of topical authority, we’ll devise a plan to create robust content pillars. By organising and mapping future content around these pillars, we build a coherent and compelling narrative. And to add an interactive twist, we aim to include video content – be it insightful snippets from our consultants or engaging animated visuals.  

Step 6. The SEO Buffet: Serving Diverse SEO Delicacies.  

As we progress, it's essential to stay dynamic. Thus, we'll choose from our menu of SEO actions to keep the strategy robust:

*   Internal links audits – Scheduled every three months.
*   Schema reviews – Diving deeper than before.
*   Peripheral SEO elements exploration – For instance, optimising breadcrumbs for enhanced user navigation.
*   Competitor content gap analysis – Keeping an eye on the competition to seize opportunities they might have missed.
*   Advanced OPRs vs. New Page Needs – Deciding if a basic page tweak suffices or if a more intricate design OPR is warranted.

Month 4 is all about refinement. It’s where we validate the effectiveness of our strategies, implement changes where necessary, and continue the journey upwards, ensuring your brand narrative stays strong and reaches its intended audience.
